In this deliverable, you must implement the instructor functionality. This includes viewing
all scheduled fitness classes, scheduling a class that the instructor will teach, and editing
their existing classes.

The instructor is able to view a list of all scheduled classes. They are also able to search by
class name (ex. “Karate” or “Tai Chi”) and instructor names (including their own name).

An instructor user can choose to teach a class. To do so, the instructor selects the type of
fitness they will teach (from the options that the admin created). Then the instructor
selects the difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced), the day of the week, and
the time interval that the class will be scheduled for. Finally, the instructor enters a
maximum capacity for the class.

The instructor user can also cancel a class. This removes the class and all specified details
(day, hours, difficulty level, and class capacity).

An instructor cannot schedule a class that is already scheduled by another instructor on
the same day. (Ex. instructor cannot schedule a HIIT class on Thursday if there already
exists a HIIT class on Thursday). Either include a valid error message upon saving, or
change the UI to reflect this case.
